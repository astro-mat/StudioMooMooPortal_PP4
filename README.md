#### Epic 1 - Initial project setup







<!-- what would we like when visiting Studio Portal?
What kind of features would it provide its users?
1) The ability to create, Read, update and delete a booking for a recording session
2) the ability to stream and download rough mixes from recording sessions

  1) Create, Read, Update and Delete bookings
  2)  View booking history

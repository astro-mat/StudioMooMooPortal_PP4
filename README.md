what would we like when visiting Studio Portal?
What kind of features would it provide its users?
1) The ability to create, Read, update and delete a booking for a recording session
2) the ability to stream and download rough mixes from recording sessions
3) signup process to be easy and frictionless

Problem statement: How do I develop a portal application that delivers this functionality to a user?

A user can view available time slots for the studio. 
A normal user is logged in they can access the portal content including: 
  1) Create, Read, Update and Delete bookings
  2)  View booking history
  3)  Stream/Download recordings made at studio
  4)  Manage their account settings

An Admin user can 
  1) Create, Read, Update and Delete bookings
  2) Create, read, Update and delete recordings
